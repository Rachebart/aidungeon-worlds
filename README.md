# aidungeon-worlds

This repository is a collection of AIDungeon worldinfo files based on existing universes (Cyberpunk 2077, Harry Potter, LOTR..)
Worldinfo files are for the biggest part generated using the aid-fdimport tool, also authored by me, which is able to extract informations from fandom.com wikis and tranlate them into worldinfo json files.
