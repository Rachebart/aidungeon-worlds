Nomads are generally a very libertarian and independent people, and the Snake Nation is a loose confederation of those who, though they wanted to preserve their autonomy, wanted a voice in nomad politics. Unofficially, they can be said to speak for the entire independent nomad population, and it is generally true that they faithfully represent the views of non-aligned nomads in North America.\n\nThe Snake Nation was created in response to the formation of the other six nations. As these larger groups began to influence and affect both nomad and static communities, the smaller nomad groups realized that to advocate their (ofttimes differing) views, they had to solidify as well. The Snake is the most loosely organized of the Seven Nations; their philosophy is clearly shown by their Revolutionary-era-inspired flag. On a field of red is the white likeness of a sectioned snake. When apart these sections are seemingly benign, but joined together, they can strike their enemies. The Snake Nation motto is simple, \"Don't Tread On Me:'\n\nThe Snake Nation's ranks are the most diverse of all the nations, and they have no set base of expertise upon which they base their economy. Unlike the Bloods with their circuses and the Metas with their marine construction, the Snake Nation is an aggregation of families involved in all areas of the nomad economy. In the last two years, the Snakes have invested a great deal of effort towards acquiring larger and more lucrative construction and salvage jobs. There were Snake Nation packs involved in the construction of the TransCon Maglev, Balsam City, and the ConAg projects in Kansas, thereby building for themselves a solid base of experience, as well. It has become a policy among those of the Snake Nation that they must improve their marketability versus the well-rounded crews sent by other nations to these types of projects. The Snakes are not happy about how this competition has shaken out in the past.\n\nthumb|Freddie Douglas 2020\n\nThe nation's current leader is Freddie Douglas. Freddie came from a Mormon family out of the Utah desert. He is not amused by the power games that other groups play, and he would much prefer a world where he did not have to deal with other nations and could instead return to the simple life of an independent nomad. As a leader, Mr. Douglas is relatively inexperienced-he's only been a nomad for about a decade- but he was chosen for this post because of his stability and willingness to work with outsiders. His counsel has been good, and many value his opinion and respect his achievements even if they don't like him personally.

It quickly became the staple of a city that was common with gang related crimes, as it quickly rose up to it during the late 1960's.\n\n\nChicago was a city hit hard during the Collapse, especially in the beginning. Chicago after this point was absolutely devastated, but, this amount of damage could not compare to the events of the infamous bio-plague that attacked the city. Although people thought it was a derivative of the Ebola virus, the bio-plague was actually created by the Federal Government. The bio-plague was primarily made by the research of many universities, the most deadly of research done in places like Heartland.\n\nHeartland was a secret complex in Chicago built during WWII under the University of Chicago, originally made for the Manhattan Project. When primary research was going much faster than planned, the complex sat in disuse until the early 1960's. Just before the Vietnam War, the Heartland complex was turned into a large bio-agent and chemical research facility. It's funding came from the NSC/DIA, and literally billions were poured into it. Most of America's bio-arsenal came from there. Despite their successes in biological warfare, Heartland eventually closed. The facility was too cramped and outdated to bear another remodeling. But, the thing was, there was some things they couldn't remove without tearing up parts of the University. So they left them alone, which saved them millions in the process.\n\nSo, years later, after the facility closed much of what was being worked on and already made remained there. Samples of the worlds most deadliest diseases on the entire planet just sat there. Collecting dust. When the worst of the Collapse came, there was nothing the government could do that could change the situation. Eventually, the NSA filled the entry corridors with cement, slapped bio-hazard warnings all over the place and left off to fight a war against the government and military with the rest of the Gang of Four.\n\nMuch later during the end of 2011, reconstruction on the University of Chicago began. The reconstruction companies demolished much of the old buildings on campus, and when the complex was discovered they ignored the bio-hazard signs and started demolishing it, releasing many of those diseases that Heartland was creating. After that, all hell broke lose.\n\nWithin six months, the entire city of Chicago had been destroyed. The death toll was close to about 200,000. Although some parts of the city were still livable, most residents moved to safer parts of the country. After the plague, Chicago Port was built by the U.S. Military after they realized that without Chicago Great Lakes shipping was crippled.\n\nChicago still remained a wasteland; nomad heaven.\n\n\nAfter the Collapse, most of Chicago remained empty and destroyed. It is said 90% of all of Chicago is empty. A true husk of what it once was. Algae and overgrowth ran rapid across the city, and the rust on old buildings glared proudly in the sunlight. It seemed nothing could be done about this old city. That was until Storm Technologies entered the scene.\n\nStorm Technologies Incorporated (often abbreviated StormTech), is a technological company started by Dr. Richard Storm in the late 90's. One of the many huge and lucrative projects StormTech wanted to accomplish was the successful reclamation of Chicago. When toxicity levels in the city went down to manageable levels, StormTech was able to negotiate a lucrative deal with four of the seven Nations to start the reconstruction of Chicago.\n\nStormTech, since 2017, has been sending groups of people into Chicago to salvage certain critical resources. They have slowly been able to reclaim and rebuild a certain parts of Chicago, like The Loop and New Town. Though there are still other parts which aren't so lucky. Nowadays, Chicago is mainly traversed by Nomad groups and gangs looking to make a living.",

It was adjacent to the famous Med Center, and as a result the whole area flourished and prospered. Nowadays, with all the other corpos either dissolved by Arasaka or transferred to the other bank of the gulf, Kabuki is possibly the poorest sub-district of the city outside of Pacifica.\n\nThe area was quickly repopulated with Chinese diaspora before turning into the shadiest bazaar imaginable. During the daytime Kabuki has narrow, tangled alleyways full of chop suey joints, seedy cosmetic boutiques, and cheap junk shops, all decorated with Chinese lampions and flickering neon lights. During the night, Kabuki is the heart of Night City's black market for all manner of illegal transactions. Implants, organs, combat drugs, prototype cyber augmentations, steroids, synth-viruses, snuff braindance recordings-it's all there to buy if you know the right places and people.

It was adjacent to the famous Med Center, and as a result the whole area flourished and prospered. Nowadays, with all the other corpos either dissolved by Arasaka or transferred to the other bank of the gulf, Kabuki is possibly the poorest sub-district of the city outside of Pacifica.\n\nThe area was quickly repopulated with Chinese diaspora before turning into the shadiest bazaar imaginable. During the daytime Kabuki has narrow, tangled alleyways full of chop suey joints, seedy cosmetic boutiques, and cheap junk shops, all decorated with Chinese lampions and flickering neon lights. During the night, Kabuki is the heart of Night City's black market for all manner of illegal transactions. Implants, organs, combat drugs, prototype cyber augmentations, steroids, synth-viruses, snuff braindance recordings-it's all there to buy if you know the right places and people.

The local ambulance companies no longer make runs here, because too many of the casualties of this club couldn't pay their bills. Late at night, groups of boostergangers will make trips to Medicross Preservation (on High Street near Sterling) to finance their next round of drinks.\n\nThe NCPD let Totentanz stay open for two reasons: one; it kills the punks, and two; the gangs would get very upset if the place got closed down. The two story building east of the tower used to be a general store. It went out of business several years ago, and has remained deserted ever since. Lord only knows what goes on inside there now.

It was well-known as a place to find boostergangs, who all seemed to congregate there, but didn't come to dance. It was considered a bad night if the body count was under twenty. (pg.310)\n\nAt some point, the bar was relocated to an abandoned hotel in the Watson industrial sector.\n\nBy 2077, the Maelstrom gang have been using it as one of their bases of operation.Cyberpunk 2077 on Twitter The TTC is the most popular gangster club and \"drink&riot\" venue in Night City.

    "entry": "The top three floors of the building are occupied by Totentanz, a poorly-supervised club where a lot of boostergang members go to work up some adrenaline before getting laid. The music is loud, the drinks strong, and the patrons rowdy to an extreme. The local ambulance companies no longer make runs here, because too many of the casualties of this club couldn't pay their bills. Late at night, groups of boostergangers will make trips to Medicross Preservation (on High Street near Sterling) to finance their next round of drinks.\n\nThe NCPD let Totentanz stay open for two reasons: one; it kills the punks, and two; the gangs would get very upset if the place got closed down. The two story building east of the tower used to be a general store. It went out of business several years ago, and has remained deserted ever since. Lord only knows what goes on inside there now. Rumor has it Night City plans to buy the building for a municipal annex. (pg.70-71)\n\nIn 2023, Totentanz barely escaped the AHQ Disaster. By 2045, the bar was at the edge of then named Hot Zone. It was well-known as a place to find boostergangs, who all seemed to congregate there, but didn't come to dance. It was considered a bad night if the body count was under twenty. (pg.310)\n\nAt some point, the bar was relocated to an abandoned hotel in the Watson industrial sector.\n\nBy 2077, the Maelstrom gang have been using it as one of their bases of operation.Cyberpunk 2077 on Twitter The TTC is the most popular gangster club and \"drink&riot\" venue in Night City. Other gangers go there to party and listen to neo-death metal music as long as they obey the Maelstrom's authority and customs.

Now the massive new office and apartment buildings, corporate hotels, and restaurants emanate a unique posh vibe. During the night the wide streets are well-lit and buzzing, filled with people and traffic. Neon signs are everywhere, advertising all kinds of pubs, bars, strip clubs, fast food joints and \"one night\" hotels. Being an upper-tier district, Downtown is also the social heart of Night City.\n\nLike the rest of Night City, Downtown has a second face that's hidden during the day and seen only by night. It has dark alleys, shadowy spots, and sleazy hotels where drug deals go down and black braindance is produced. These are the places gangers from other districts come to have their own kind of fun, and some of them even work as bouncers and bodyguards.",

    "description": "Formed after the Collapse, Appalachia is made up of the states of Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nAppalachia, despite the fact that it is comprised of only five states (plus the remora of D.C.), is the most politically powerful of the regions of the United States. The Free State Board could be a more powerful political factor, and might even overwhelm the Appalachian region, but the structure of new U.S. government, added to the fact that the FSB rarely votes in unison, causes their influence to be diminished.\n\nThroughout the Twentieth Century, the Appalachian states remained by and large a backwater. The major metropolitan developments were restricted to the Atlantic coast; large sections of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Virginias remained relatively uninhabited, and ignored by followers of pop culture as backwaters and the refuge of the hillbillies. Fortunately, though, these states avoided most of the ecosystem damage caused by the acid rains of the northeast, and the prevalence of forested areas helped the land weather the droughts and global warming in good shape. Overall, the climate in this part of the country has changed little.\n\nExtremely low land prices combined with ready supplies of workers and raw materials brought industry here around the turn of the millennium, and shortly afterwards Appalachia became the new boom section of the country. TerraTech began extensive underground tunneling and mining activity, then converted their main shafts into superhighways which undercut the winding Appalachian roads. Stoked by the ready supplies of lumber, ore, and self-sufficient construction workers, new towns sprang up quickly, providing homes for the Corporate beavers who flocked here by the thousands.\n\nOver the next ten years, Appalachia underwent a renaissance the likes of which have not been seen in America since the Old West was opened up.

    "entry": "Formed after the Collapse, Appalachia is made up of the states of Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nAppalachia, despite the fact that it is comprised of only five states (plus the remora of D.C.), is the most politically powerful of the regions of the United States. The Free State Board could be a more powerful political factor, and might even overwhelm the Appalachian region, but the structure of new U.S. government, added to the fact that the FSB rarely votes in unison, causes their influence to be diminished.\n\nThroughout the Twentieth Century, the Appalachian states remained by and large a backwater. The major metropolitan developments were restricted to the Atlantic coast; large sections of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Virginias remained relatively uninhabited, and ignored by followers of pop culture as backwaters and the refuge of the hillbillies. Fortunately, though, these states avoided most of the ecosystem damage caused by the acid rains of the northeast, and the prevalence of forested areas helped the land weather the droughts and global warming in good shape. Overall, the climate in this part of the country has changed little.\n\nExtremely low land prices combined with ready supplies of workers and raw materials brought industry here around the turn of the millennium, and shortly afterwards Appalachia became the new boom section of the country. TerraTech began extensive underground tunneling and mining activity, then converted their main shafts into superhighways which undercut the winding Appalachian roads. Stoked by the ready supplies of lumber, ore, and self-sufficient construction workers, new towns sprang up quickly, providing homes for the Corporate beavers who flocked here by the thousands.\n\nOver the next ten years, Appalachia underwent a renaissance the likes of which have not been seen in America since the Old West was opened up. Entire small towns were bought, leveled, and rebuilt as planned communities. Industry of every sort moved in, providing an ease of networking found nowhere else in the states. Of the Fortune 1000 companies of 2020, each has a major corporate office in these states.\n\nThe heartbeat of the nation can now be felt here.
