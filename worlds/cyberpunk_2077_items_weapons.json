    "name": "IEC Dragoon",
    "description": "The modern battlefield sees many impressive weapons\u2014remote-controlled drones, STOVL stealth fighters, minitanks, combat bikes, anti-tank vehicles, power-assisted infantry armor, and AV-type ground attack craft. However, the ultimate multi-role land-deployed combat unit is the \"Dragoon\" cybersystem. IEC, holders of the U.S. military cybernetics contract, designed the Dragoon to be the most deadly weapon any army could have. Variants of the Dragoon have, predictably, sold well overseas. Being a strictly military weapon, the Dragoon is absolutely impossible to buy on the open market, and even the most powerful of corporations have a hard time getting ahold of these (except for IEC, that is). Measuring over 8 feet in height, and weighing in at 620 pounds, the Dragoon is arguably the most powerful full conversion in existence.\n\nThe Dragoon's advantage over all other land-based combat units is its humanoid form. It is capable of taking maximum advantage of terrain, it can enter buildings, hold territory and perform every part of a military operation, from guerrilla warfare to anti-aircraft artillery. Its performance levels give it equal speed (and superior all-terrain capability) to a 4x4 combat car, while it can go where no car ever could: treetops, maintenance tunnels, even vehicle cockpits. Combined with this unbeatable mobility is the Dragoon's inherent toughness: its armor plating consists of a monocrystalline ceramic composite with an ablative layer of heat-displacing ceramics and foamed metal (full SP vs lasers, etc), while its critical system redundancies and raw ability to soak damage make it the rough equivalent of an AFV. In this respect, the Dragoon can easily function as a perimeter patrol and defense unit, as well as an anti-site fast-attack system. It is also a fearsome opponent to troops and vehicles.\n\nAs a military weapon, Dragoon has many subsystems which are vital on the battlefield as standard features. It has a wide array of detection, acquisition and designation systems, backup sensors, environmental scanners and communications gear which maximize its chances of getting that most precious of commodities: current data on your foe. However, the Dragoon is not a dedicated design; rather, its modular construction allows it to custom-tailor its equipment to suit almost any role. All four of its limbs are interchangeable, allowing it to mount almost any type of weapons, from a suppressed SMG for special ops to a heavy machinegun or railcannon for anti-vehicular combat. The Dragoon is also fully protected against nuclear, biological, chemical and electronic warfare, giving it greatly enhanced staying power in an extended engagement.\n\nThe most immediately obvious problem with such a full body conversion package is the almost guaranteed development of devastating cyberpsychosis. It is true that a human brain, implanted in such a body, cannot easily cope with so many new senses and capabilities. IEC overcame this problem: the Dragoon, being a restricted, combat-use body, comes with an interchangeable biopod. This biopod, which houses the cyborg's biosystems, normally inhabits an \"off-duty body,\" usually an Alpha Class. The Dragoon is only fitted with the biopod, and the human mind within, when it is actively performing missions. To ensure reliable performance from the Dragoon, a Behavioral Inhibitor Program in the cyborg's on-board computer (operating in concert with a chemical injection system loaded with psychoactives) restrict the Borg's thought processes, turning it into a loyal soldier. Battle-proven in the Brushfire Wars of 2018, the Dragoon's prowess and dependability are assured.\n\nNote: The Behavioral Inhibitor Program and its battery of psychoactives do, indeed, keep the cyborg from going cyberpsycho (in the conventional sense). Basically, anyone whose biopod is in this body will act like a robot, unimaginative and literal minded. The borg's commanding officer says \"Do this,\" and the Dragoon says \"Yes, sir...\" and does it. Because Dragoons are so straightforward-thinking, they are given very specific orders with carefully-laid out parameters. They are also easy to trick, so truly sensitive work is still left to more human operatives. A common mission would be to send a Dragoon into a sector which has been cleared of friendly forces and have it kill anyone it finds, then return. Those soldiers who have been the \"minds\" of Dragoons are not comfortable with the experience, likening it to being in a dream (or nightmare).PONDSMITH, M. Chromebook Volume 2. 1st ed.

Being a strictly military weapon, the Dragoon is absolutely impossible to buy on the open market, and even the most powerful of corporations have a hard time getting ahold of these (except for IEC, that is). Measuring over 8 feet in height, and weighing in at 620 pounds, the Dragoon is arguably the most powerful full conversion in existence.\n\nThe Dragoon's advantage over all other land-based combat units is its humanoid form. It is capable of taking maximum advantage of terrain, it can enter buildings, hold territory and perform every part of a military operation, from guerrilla warfare to anti-aircraft artillery. Its performance levels give it equal speed (and superior all-terrain capability) to a 4x4 combat car, while it can go where no car ever could: treetops, maintenance tunnels, even vehicle cockpits. Combined with this unbeatable mobility is the Dragoon's inherent toughness: its armor plating consists of a monocrystalline ceramic composite with an ablative layer of heat-displacing ceramics and foamed metal (full SP vs lasers, etc), while its critical system redundancies and raw ability to soak damage make it the rough equivalent of an AFV. In this respect, the Dragoon can easily function as a perimeter patrol and defense unit, as well as an anti-site fast-attack system. It is also a fearsome opponent to troops and vehicles.\n\nAs a military weapon, Dragoon has many subsystems which are vital on the battlefield as standard features. It has a wide array of detection, acquisition and designation systems, backup sensors, environmental scanners and communications gear which maximize its chances of getting that most precious of commodities: current data on your foe. However, the Dragoon is not a dedicated design; rather, its modular construction allows it to custom-tailor its equipment to suit almost any role. All four of its limbs are interchangeable, allowing it to mount almost any type of weapons, from a suppressed SMG for special ops to a heavy machinegun or railcannon for anti-vehicular combat. The Dragoon is also fully protected against nuclear, biological, chemical and electronic warfare, giving it greatly enhanced staying power in an extended engagement.\n\nThe most immediately obvious problem with such a full body conversion package is the almost guaranteed development of devastating cyberpsychosis. It is true that a human brain, implanted in such a body, cannot easily cope with so many new senses and capabilities. IEC overcame this problem: the Dragoon, being a restricted, combat-use body, comes with an interchangeable biopod. This biopod, which houses the cyborg's biosystems, normally inhabits an \"off-duty body,\" usually an Alpha Class. The Dragoon is only fitted with the biopod, and the human mind within, when it is actively performing missions. To ensure reliable performance from the Dragoon, a Behavioral Inhibitor Program in the cyborg's on-board computer (operating in concert with a chemical injection system loaded with psychoactives) restrict the Borg's thought processes, turning it into a loyal soldier. Battle-proven in the Brushfire Wars of 2018, the Dragoon's prowess and dependability are assured.\n\nNote: The Behavioral Inhibitor Program and its battery of psychoactives do, indeed, keep the cyborg from going cyberpsycho (in the conventional sense). Basically, anyone whose biopod is in this body will act like a robot, unimaginative and literal minded. The borg's commanding officer says \"Do this,\" and the Dragoon says \"Yes, sir...\" and does it. Because Dragoons are so straightforward-thinking, they are given very specific orders with carefully-laid out parameters. They are also easy to trick, so truly sensitive work is still left to more human operatives. A common mission would be to send a Dragoon into a sector which has been cleared of friendly forces and have it kill anyone it finds, then return. Those soldiers who have been the \"minds\" of Dragoons are not comfortable with the experience, likening it to being in a dream (or nightmare).PONDSMITH, M. Chromebook Volume 2. 1st ed.

    "description": "The Oriental martial arts advise turning your enemy's strengths into weaknesses. Arasaka has taken this to heart Militech's great strength lies in its heavy metal: tanks and powered armors in numbers too great for Arasaka to fight The answer was to strike at the enemy's pressure points, to tum the mass of armor from a barrier into a way to damage the foe.\n\nThe EMF launcher is little more than a normal antitank rocket launcher; the light is a normal one-shot LAW, while the heavy corresponds to the RPG. The only difference is that the shaped-charge warheads are replaced with special high-energy capacitors tipped with a \"super-glue\" bonding element The warhead sticks to the target and discharges polarized electricity into the targets armor, briefly magnetizing that armor and propagating the magnetic field into the vehicle's interior This field polarizes and damages computer chips and circuits inside the target rendering them useless. You don't have to blow up an enemy to neutralize him!\n\nGame effects are as follows: If the target is hit by the round, roll damage location and penetration as normal. If over 10 points of \"damage\" get through the targets armor, the affected location will lose all electronics in that location (count the equipment as \"destroyed,\" except it has no chance of exploding). ACPA's affected in this fashion lose the use of affected limbs and all equipment mounted there; if the torso is affected, the whole armored suit shuts down!\n\nImportant note: None of this damage is real! These rounds do NO SDP damage!! (If a live target is struck by one, though, count the hit as ID6 concussion for light rounds and 2D6 concussion for heavy rounds\u2014and hope you're not magnetic! because if you are, the shock will shunt into you, doing the listed damage through your armor\u2014ouchie.)\n\nMilitech is developing a countermeasure: Nonmagnetic paste laid over a mildly-charged copper grid covering the vehicle's exposed surfaces. This quite effectively diffuses the electromagnetic burst assuming the round doesn't bounce off in the first place. Of course, this coating can be ablated away by normal gunfire (10+ hits with a machinegun, auto grenade launcher, or autocannon will eat away a hole that gives an EMF launcher gunner a clear shot\u2014count it as a called shot at a small target), and it doesn't cover everything (roll 1D10\u2014on vehicles, a roll of 9-10 means rocket missed the protective coating. A roll of 7+ does the same when shooting at ACPA's).\n\nThe light launcher is a one-shot, the heavy launcher is reloadable (1000eb per round), and nonlaunchable, potato-masher hand grenades can bought for 500eb (act as Light launcher rounds for damage effects).ACKERMAN GREY, D.

Two things are readily apparent when you first pick up this weapon. The first is the lack of interfacing for the shooter. This weapon is designed for military forces in the Third World who don't fit their soldiers with chips and plugs. Second is the old-fashioned configuration in an age where bullpups are the style. Side-folding stock and a 1.2x optical sight are standard options on the weapon. Because of the large numbers of these guns exported out of the Hong Kong trade zone, and their very low cost, the M-9 has become a common sight in the Third World and on the streets.\n\nNote: This gun normally uses special hollow-nosed ammo (armor SP x2; damage that penetrates is x1.5); standard ball ammo would do 4D6 damage. The hollow-nose ammo is 45 eb per box of 100 rounds, and is only available in the Pacific Rim.",
